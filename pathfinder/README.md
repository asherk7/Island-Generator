# Assignment A4: Urbanism

- Asher Khan [khanm406@mcmaster.ca]  

rationale: Simulating settlements and urbanism development on your generated island mesh can have a range of applications, 
from improving urban planning to serving as an educational tool. By enabling urbanists to create more realistic and effective plans for building and managing cities,
your island mesh generator can contribute to the development of more sustainable and resilient urban environments.
  
explanation for extending library by implementing a new algorithm: I created a new graph adt that contains nodes and edges,
that can be used to model any graph as it can take in any property. Expanding the pathfinder library and 
implementing new algorithms can improve the accuracy, flexibility, scalability, and customization of the simulation of settlement 
and urbanism development on your island mesh. By investing in the development of the library, you can create more realistic 
and effective road networks that reflect the unique characteristics of the island mesh and the needs of the simulation
  
definition of the shortest path: A path with the smallest weight across edges/segments
